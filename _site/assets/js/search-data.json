    "title": "Abstract",
    "content": "This paper describes the application of the Gabor filtering protocol to a Master/Slave (MS) swept source optical coherence tomography (SS)-OCT system at 1300 nm. The MS-OCT system delivers information from selected depths, a property that allows operation similar to that of a time domain OCT system, where dynamic focusing is possible. The Gabor filtering processing following collection of multiple data from different focus positions is different from that utilized by a conventional swept source OCT system using a Fast Fourier transform (FFT) to produce an A-scan. Instead of selecting the bright parts of A-scans for each focus position, to be placed in a final B-scan image (or in a final volume), and discarding the rest, the MS principle can be employed to advantageously deliver signal from the depths within each focus range only. The MS procedure is illustrated on creating volumes of data of constant transversal resolution from a cucumber and from an insect by repeating data acquisition for 4 different focus positions. In addition, advantage is taken from the tolerance to dispersion of the MS principle that allows automatic compensation for dispersion created by layers above the object of interest. By combining the two techniques, Gabor filtering and Master/Slave, a powerful imaging instrument is demonstrated. The master/slave technique allows simultaneous display of three categories of images in one frame: multiple depth en-face OCT images, two cross-sectional OCT images and a confocal like image obtained by averaging the en-face ones. We also demonstrate the superiority of MS-OCT over its FFT based counterpart when used with a Gabor filtering OCT instrument in terms of the speed of assembling the fused volume. For our case, we show that when more than 4 focus positions are required to produce the final volume, MS is faster than the conventional FFT based procedure. ",

    "content": "The morphology of embryos produced by in vitro fertilization (IVF) is commonly used to estimate their viability. However, imaging by standard microscopy is subjective and unable to assess the embryo on a cellular scale after compaction. Optical coherence tomography is an imaging technique that can produce a depth-resolved profile of a sample and can be coupled with speckle variance (SV) to detect motion on a micron scale. In this study, day 7 post-IVF bovine embryos were observed either short-term (10 minutes) or long-term (over 18 hours) and analyzed by swept source OCT and SV to resolve their depth profile and characterize micron-scale movements potentially associated with viability. The percentage of en-face images showing movement at any given time was calculated as a method to detect the vital status of the embryo. This method could be used to measure the levels of damage sustained by an embryo, for example after cryopreservation, in a rapid and non-invasive way. ",

The 2-octave bandwidth (475-2300 nm) makes the SC source suitable for optical coherence tomography (OCT) as well as for multispectral photoacoustic microscopy (MPAM). The IR band centered at 1310 nm is chosen for OCT to penetrate deeper into tissue with 8 mW average power on the sample. The 500-840 nm band is used for MPAM. The source has the ability to select the central wavelength as well as the spectral bandwidth. An energy of more than 35 nJ within a less than 50 nm bandwidth is achieved on the sample for wavelengths longer than 500 nm. In the present paper, we demonstrate the capabilities of such a multimodality imaging instrument based on a single optical source. In-vitro mouse ear B-scan images are presented. ",

    "content": "Some forensic in situ investigations, such as those needed in transportation (for aviation, maritime, road, or rail accidents) or for parts working under harsh conditions (e.g., pipes or turbines) would benefit from a method/technique that distinguishes ductile from brittle fractures of metals—as material defects are one of the potential causes of incidents. Nowadays, the gold standard in material studies is represented by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). However, SEM instruments are large, expensive, time-consuming, and lab-based; hence, in situ measurements are impossible. To tackle these issues, we propose as an alternative, lower-cost, sufficiently high-resolution technique, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to perform fracture analysis by obtaining the topography of metallic surfaces. Several metals have been considered in this study: low soft carbon steels, lamellar graphite cast iron, an antifriction alloy, high-quality rolled steel, stainless steel, and ductile cast iron. An in-house developed Swept Source (SS) OCT system, Master-Slave (MS) enhanced is used, and height profiles of the samples’ surfaces were generated. Two configurations were used: one where the dimension of the voxel was 1000 μm^3 and a second one of 160 μm^3—with a 10 μm and a 4 μm transversal resolution, respectively. These height profiles allowed for concluding that the carbon steel samples were subject to ductile fracture, while the cast iron and antifriction alloy samples were subjected to brittle fracture. The validation of OCT images has been made with SEM images obtained with a 4 nm resolution. Although the OCT images are of a much lower resolution than the SEM ones, we demonstrate that they are sufficiently good to obtain clear images of the grains of the metallic materials and thus to distinguish between ductile and brittle fractures—especially with the higher resolution MS/SS-OCT system. The investigation is finally extended to the most useful case of fatigue fracture of metals, and we demonstrate that OCT is able to replace SEM for such investigations as well . ",

    "content": "We present an optical coherence tomography (OCT) method that can deliver an en-face OCT image from a sample in real-time, irrespective of the tuning speed of the swept source. The method, based on the master slave interferometry technique, implements a coherence gate principle by requiring that the optical path difference (OPD) between the arms of an imaging interferometer is the same with the OPD in an interrogating interferometer. In this way, a real-time en-face OCT image can originate from a depth in the sample placed in the imaging interferometer, selected by actuating on the OPD in the interrogating interferometer, while laterally scanning the incident beam over the sample. The generation of the en-face image resembles time domain OCT, with the difference that here the signal is processed based on spectral domain OCT. The optoelectronic processor operates down-conversion of the chirped radio frequency signal delivered by the photo-detector. The down-conversion factor is equal to the ratio of the maximum frequency of the photo-detected signal due to an OPD value matching the coherence length of the swept source, to the sweeping rate. This factor can exceed 106 for long coherence swept sources. ",

However, the development of Mueller microscopes poses an instrumental challenge: the production of polarimetric parameters must be sufficiently quick to ensure fast imaging, so that the evolution of these parameters can be visualised in real-time, allowing the operator to adjust the microscope while constantly monitoring them. In this report, a full Mueller scanning microscope based on spectral encoding of polarization is presented. The spectrum, collected every 10 $\\mu$s for each position of the optical beam on the specimen, incorporates all the information needed to produce the full Mueller matrix, which allows simultaneous display of all the polarimetric parameters, at the unequalled rate of 1.5 Hz (for an image of 256 $\\times$ 256 pixels). The design of the optical blocks allows for the real-time display of linear birefringent images which serve as guidance for the operator. In addition, the instrument has the capability to easily switch its functionality from a Mueller to a Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) microscope, providing a pixel-to-pixel matching of the images produced by the two modalities. The device performance is illustrated by imaging various unstained biological specimens. ",

This can lead to variations of the sintering temperature outside the range recommended by the manufacturer. Stress and even fractures in dental ceramics may occur, and this leads to the necessity to rebuild the dental construct. The aim of this work is to monitor the quality of sintering processes using an established biomedical imaging technique—optical coherence tomography (OCT). Conventional current procedures imply the fabrication of supplemental samples that add to the expenses and are only evaluated visually. To our knowledge, we were the first to propose the use of OCT, a non-destructive method that brings objectivity for such assessments, focusing, in a previous study, on metal ceramic dental prostheses. Here, a different material, pressed ceramics, is considered, while we propose a quantitative assessment of the results—using reflectivity profiles of en-face (i.e., constant-depth) OCT images of sintered samples. The results for both the pressed ceramics and metal ceramics prostheses are discussed by obtaining the analytic functions of their reflectivity profiles. A multi-parametric analysis demonstrates the best parameter to characterize the loss of calibration of dental ovens. Rules-of-thumb are extracted; producing dental prostheses with efects can thus be avoided. ",

Bone formation is quantitatively assessed in 5 mm cylindrical defects made in the calvaria part of the skull of living rats. Samples are divided in three study groups: A, a negative control group, for which the natural healing process of the defect is investigated; B, a positive control group, for which bovine graft is used to stimulate bone formation, and C, a study group, in which bovine graft is added to the created defects and LLLT is applied throughout the entire healing period. The animals are sacrificed after 14, 21, and 30 days, and the samples are imaged using the multimodal CMS/SS-OCT instrument. ",

By analyzing the evolution of this volume of new bone in time, the most significant difference was after 21 days, therefore approximately after two thirds of the total time interval analyzed. After 30 days, the volumes of bone tend to move closer, as they begin to fill the available gap.

    "content": "We report a compact rigid instrument capable of delivering en-face optical coherence tomography (OCT) images alongside (epi)-fluorescence endomicroscopy (FEM) images by means of a robotic scanning device. Two working imaging channels are included: one for a one-dimensional scanning, forward-viewing OCT probe and another for a fiber bundle used for the FEM system. The robotic scanning system provides the second axis of scanning for the OCT channel while allowing the field of view (FoV) of the FEM channel to be increased by mosaicking. The OCT channel has resolutions of 25  /  60  μm (axial/lateral) and can provide en-face images with an FoV of 1.6  ×  2.7  mm2. The FEM channel has a lateral resolution of better than 8  μm and can generate an FoV of 0.53  ×  3.25  mm2 through mosaicking. The reproducibility of the scanning was determined using phantoms to be better than the lateral resolution of the OCT channel. Combined OCT and FEM imaging were validated with ex-vivo ovine and porcine tissues, with the instrument mounted on an arm to ensure constant contact of the probe with the tissue. The OCT imaging system alone was validated for in-vivo human dermal imaging with the handheld instrument. In both cases, the instrument was capable of resolving fine features such as the sweat glands in human dermal tissue and the alveoli in porcine lung tissue. ",

Xenopus laevis tadpoles were imaged in vivo using the whole spectral range of 2000 nm of a supercontinuum optical source, and a novel technique of mapping absorbers is also demonstrated, based on the supposition that only one chromophore contributes to the photoacoustic signal of each individual voxel in the 3D photoacoustic image. By using a narrow spectral window (of 25 nm bandwidth) within the broad spectrum of the supercontinuum source at a time, in-vivo hyper-spectral Photoacoustic images of tadpoles are obtained. By post-processing pairs of images obtained using different spectral windows, maps of five endogenous contrast agents (hemoglobin, melanin, collagen, glucose and lipids) are produced. ",

    "content": "3D-printed materials are present in numerous applications, from medicine to engineering. The aim of this study is to assess their suitability for an application of interest today, that of testing of 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA)-based reactors for biogas production using anaerobic digestion. The impact of temperature, pH, and aqueous phase on the tested bioreactor is investigated, together with the effect of the gaseous phase (i.e., produced biogas). Two batches of materials used separately, one after another inside the bioreactor were considered, in a realistic situation. Two essential parameters inside the reactor (i.e., pH and temperature) were continuously monitored during a time interval of 25 to 30 days for each of the two biogas-generating processes. To understand the impact of these processes on the walls of the bioreactor, samples of 3D-printed material were placed at three levels: at the top (i.e., outside the substrate), in the middle, and at the bottom of the bioreactor. The samples were analyzed using a non-destructive imaging method, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). An in-house developed swept-source (SS) OCT system, master–slave (MS) enhanced, operating at a central wavelength of 1310 nm was utilized. The 3D OCT images related to the degradation level of the material of the PLA samples were validated using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The differences between the impact of the substrate on samples situated at the three considered levels inside the reactor were determined and analyzed using their OCT B-scans (optical cross-section images). Thus, the impact of the biogas-generating process on the interior of the bioreactor was demonstrated and quantified, as well as the capability of OCT to perform such assessments. Therefore, future work may target OCT for in situ investigations of such bioreactors. ",

    "content": "In ophthalmology, functional changes, such as the oxygenation of the retinal tissue, precede structural changes, which are very often first observed using the currently available technologies, therefore having the capability to detect them earlier is of paramount importance. Nowadays, several imaging techniques including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), which steadily is becoming the gold standard, in producing structural images are used for diagnosing eye diseases in humans. However, none of these techniques is capable to provide accurate oxygen saturation maps of the retinal tissue, critical in investigating major blinding eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. One of the imaging techniques which has the capability to provide oxygenation maps of the biological tissue is opto-acoustic tomography (OAT). Unfortunately, OAT requires contact between the instrument and the tissue, therefore it is not suitable for in-vivo imaging the eye. Recently, a novel technique based on OAT, opto-acoustic remote sensing (OARS), not requiring contact with the tissue, has been demonstrated. Through this project, the capability of OARS to deliver retinal oxygenation maps of the eye’s retina will be evaluated. To this goal, multimodality imaging instruments equipped with OARS and OCT control channels will be developed to simultaneously produce functional and structural maps. The capability of this instrument in detecting abnormal retinal oxygenation levels in the retina will be analysed with collaborators from NHS Trust. ",

The PhD project will support research and development of a low-cost investigational device for noncommunicable diseases leading to blindness if not diagnosed and treated. These are preventable and the lack of essential services primarily affects developing countries where clinics cannot afford current OCT instruments, expensive and bulky. The research will focus on innovative solutions for portable, miniature, low-cost imaging systems, that can be used by a non-specialist to perform OCT imaging of the eye. The project intends to evaluate several novel avenues opened by recent research in Photonics that will be harnessed to lower significantly the cost of OCT technology. Ideally, the system should be assembled around a low-cost camera or a smartphone to enable imaging patients in remote areas of developing countries, or to be used in pop-up eye clinics to screen for retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Such a device will generate data that will enable healthcare providers to supply cost-effective, targeted treatment, not currently possible in low-resource setting countries and environments. ",

I am a Senior Lecturer in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kent, and I am also a member of the Applied Optics Group. In this role, I work on developing imaging techniques that can be applied to the fields of biosciences and medicine. My research is mainly focused on imaging techniques that are based on optical coherence tomography, elastography and photoacoustic. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6890-1599 . I began my career at . Alexandru Ioan Cuza University Iasi . graduating in 1997 with a BSc in Physics. After graduation, I studied for my MSc degree in Optics, Optoelectronics and Microwaves at École Nationale Supérieure d’Électronique et de Radioélectricité de Grenoble (ENSERG), Grenoble, France; my MSc thesis was ‘Spectrophotometry of turbid media using optical fibre probes’. I completed my PhD in the group of Professor Jacques Derouard at Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France, in 2004. My PhD thesis title was Optical methods used to investigate biological tissues. Cerebral tissue spectroscopy using small optical fibre probes and optical coherence tomography imaging. Master Slave Interferometry . Several years ago, Prof. Podoleanu and I introduced a novel method to produce optical coherence tomography images, which serves as an alternative to the Fourier Transform based technique. We have developed this approach over time and submitted multiple patents on it. Additionally, we have published more than ten journal papers describing and elaborating on this technique. Other research activities I am involved with: . | Development of dedicated software to acquire data, display and analyse images using cutting-edge techniques and methods for camera, swept source, master-slave interferometry based Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) systems and not only. | Combining spectral and time-domain interferometry principles to implement novel configurations up to proof of concept, applicable to bio-sensing and cell, tissue imaging or imaging of different organs. | Imaging systems, combining a coherence gated wave-front sensors with one or more of the following imaging channels, optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, non-linear microscopy and then combining coherence-gated wave-front sensing with optical coherence tomography, using different or similar principles of time domain and spectral domain interferometry. | Extending the axial range in swept-source optical coherence tomography using re-circulation loops is a hot topic in the OCT community. The motivation for this work is related to the fact that one of the main drawbacks of swept-source optical coherence tomography is its limited axial range. Novel interferometer configurations are tested and equipped with adjustable path length rings in each arm. By compensating for the losses in the circles using semiconductor optical amplifiers, multiple paths A-scans can be obtained, leading to a highly long overall axial range when combined axially. The effect of the re-circulation loops is equivalent to extending the coherence length of the swept source. In this way, the axial imaging range in swept-source optical coherence tomography can be extended well beyond the limit imposed by the coherence length of the laser to exceed, in principle, many centimetres. | Non-invasive imaging of biological tissues: optical coherence tomography and confocal microscopy techniques for biological tissue imaging and adaptive optics techniques for retinal imaging. | Spectroscopy of biological media (development, measurements, interpretation; spectroscopic techniques and numerical simulations applied to biological media, optical phantoms preparation and handling). | Spectroscopy of the turbid media (development, measurements, interpretation, etc). | .
