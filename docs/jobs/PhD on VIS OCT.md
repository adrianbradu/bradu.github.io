[POSITION CLOSED](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/212/physics){: .btn .btn-blue }

We are recruiting for a fully funded PhD Studentships in Optics/Photonics/Physics for a period of 42 months with a start date in Sept/October 2022 within the Applied Optics Group, Division of Natural Sciences, University of Kent. The position is supported by EPSRC and industry.

The applicant will spend time at the University of Kent and in a company in Europe, in a combined academic/industrial supervision frame. Supervision will be provided in an European setting where specialized and complementary training will be provided at the two sites.

Research will focus on innovative solutions for fast, optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of the human eye, using visible wavelengths.
Visible light OCT theoretically provides better axial resolution than near-infrared OCT for a given wavelength bandwidth and enables novel spectroscopic studies. To realize this potential in the human retina in vivo, the unique technical challenges of visible light OCT must be
addressed. Visible light OCT raises several challenges to researchers. If these can be addressed, then novel diagnostic technology for the eye can be made available.

The applicant must have a good background in theoretical and experimental optics and expected to have graduated in Physics (Optics) or Electrical and Electronic Engineering. We are looking for a highly imaginative and self-motivated individual with expertise in lasers, interference, fibre optics, digital signal processing and prior experience of LabView or C++
and skills in interfacing I/O boards.

## Scholarship value
The scholarship includes a doctoral stipend equivalent to the Research Councils UK National Minimum Doctoral Stipend, of £16,062, tuition fees at the home rate and access to further research funding. It also includes full support to the main conference on Biomedical Optics in Europe in year 3 and a short stage at the company, in addition to specialised equipment to image the eye provided by the company.

## Criteria
Open to Home students only. To be classed as a Home student, candidates must meet the RCUK residency criteria, see appendix B.
