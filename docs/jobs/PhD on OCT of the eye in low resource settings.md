# PhD Position on OCT of the eye in low resource settings

[APPLY](https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/212/physics){: .btn .btn-blue }

**We are recruiting for a fully funded PhD Studentships in Optics/Photonics/Physics** for a period of 36 months with a start date in **September 2023** within the [Applied Optics Group](aogkent.uk), Division of Natural Sciences, [University of Kent](www.kent.ac.uk). The position is supported by the [Global Challenges Doctoral Centre in the University of Kent](https://research.kent.ac.uk/gcdc/).

The PhD project will support research and development of a low-cost investigational device for noncommunicable diseases leading to blindness if not diagnosed and treated. These are preventable and the lack of essential services primarily affects developing countries where clinics cannot afford current OCT instruments, expensive and bulky.

The research will focus on innovative solutions for portable, miniature, low-cost imaging systems, that can be used by a non-specialist to perform OCT imaging of the eye. The project intends to evaluate several novel avenues opened by recent research in Photonics that will be harnessed to lower significantly the cost of OCT technology. Ideally, the system should be assembled around a low-cost camera or a smartphone to enable imaging patients in remote areas of developing countries, or to be used in pop-up eye clinics to screen for retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Such a device will generate data that will enable healthcare providers to supply cost-effective, targeted treatment, not currently possible in low-resource setting countries and environments.

## Scholarship value
The scholarship includes a doctoral stipend equivalent to the Research Councils UK National Minimum Doctoral Stipend, of **£17,668**, tuition fees at the home rate and access to further research funding.

## Criteria
Open to Home students only. To be classed as a Home student, candidates must meet the [RCUK residency criteria](https://www.ukri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/UKRI-291020-guidance-to-training-grant-terms-and-conditions.pdf).

For more information, you may also contact [Prof Adrian Podoleanu](mailto:ap11@kent.ac.uk) or [Dr. Adrian Bradu](mailto:a.bradu@kent.ac.uk), School of Physical Sciences, Ingram, University of Kent, CT2 7NH, UK, till the closing day, **Tuesday, 28 February 2023**.
