## OCT apparatus and oct method for axial tracking and flattening ##

### ABSTRACT

The present specification relates to Master-Slave (MS) interferometry for sensing the axial position of an object subject to optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, and to MS-OCT applied to curved and axially moving objects. The methods and apparatuses allow producing OCT signals from selected depths within the object irrespective of its axial position in respect to the imaging system. Images are obtained for curved objects that are flattened along a layer of interest in the object, images that are used to provide OCT angiography images less disturbed by axial movement or lateral scanning.

## Apparatus and method for processing the signal in master slave interferometry and apparatus and method for master slave optical coherence tomography with any number of sampled depths ##

### ABSTRACT

The present invention related to an apparatus and method for master slave interferometry, referred to as Complex Master Slave (CMS). The method and apparatus can be used to provide complex-valued measurements of a signal reflected from an axial position inside an object or of signals reflected from points at several axial positions inside an object.

## Method and apparatus for processing the signal in spectral domain interferometry and method and apparatus for spectral domain optical coherence tomography

### ABSTRACT

The present invention relates to spectral domain (SD) interferometry and provides apparatuses and methods, which can be used to provide measurement of a signal reflected from an axial position inside an object or of signals reflected from points at several axial positions inside an object. Embodiments are disclosed where axial reflectivity profiles are created with no need for linearization or calibration of data. The method can be used to measure distances, or for sensing applications. Axial reflectivity profiles are constructed from several measurement points acquired and processed in parallel. For imaging technology, the invention discloses apparatuses and methods to deliver in real time, in parallel, several en-face images from different depths in the volume of an object being imaged. Embodiments are
disclosed where en-face optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are created with no need for software cuts of the volume of data collected and no need of linearization or calibration of data. Embodiments are disclosed where dispersion is automatically compensated for or compounds are detected based on the spectrum measured at the output of an interferometer.

## Optical Mapping Apparatus ##

### ABSTRACT

Optical mapping apparatus for imaging an object, comprising an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system including an OCT source, an OCT reference path leading from the OCT source to an OCT receiver, an OCT object path leading from the object to the OCT coupler, an OCT depth scanner adapted to alter at least one of the OCT reference path and the OCT receiver path. A confocal system is provided including a confocal optical receiver a confocal path leading from the object to the confocal optical receiver via a confocal input aperture. An adaptive optics (AO) system is provided to correct optical aberrations in the OCT object path and the confocal path.
