## Abstract

 In this Letter, a swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) instrument employing an innovative scanning protocol for high-speed volumetric rate imaging is demonstrated. The optical source is a tunable laser based on a supercontinuum source pumped with femtosecond pulses, followed by a time-stretched delay fiber. The instrument is equipped with an ultra-fast lateral scanner, based on a KTN crystal, driven at 100 kHz. The paper proves the utility of combining an ultra-fast lateral scanner with an ultra-fast swept laser to provide A-scans at a repetition rate of 40 MHz and an unprecedented 3D-OCT volume acquisition rate of 400 Hz.
