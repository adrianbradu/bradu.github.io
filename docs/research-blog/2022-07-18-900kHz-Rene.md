## Abstract

 In this paper, a fast dual resonance akinetic opticalswept source operating at 1550 nm is demonstrated. In-stead of modulating the optical amplifier gain reportedin our previous studies, here we employ a fiber intensitymodulator as a mode-locking element. A chirped fiberBragg grating is used to provide sufficient dispersion inthe laser cavity. A tuning range of 25 nm is obtained fora sweep frequency of  ~900 kHz with a 6 dB drop-off insensitivity at 2.6 mm optical path difference.
