I had an invited talk at the 

[1st International Conference Advances in 3OM: Opto-Mechatronics, Opto-Mechanics and Optical Metrology](https://www.bradu.eu/2021/12/15/invited-talk-at-advances-in-3om/) 
{: .text-center .fs-6}

on Combining Photoacoustic and Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging for non-destructive applications. Soon, an SPIE Proceedings on combining these two technologies are going to be published. A link will be posted here. Thanks the organisers for inviting me!
