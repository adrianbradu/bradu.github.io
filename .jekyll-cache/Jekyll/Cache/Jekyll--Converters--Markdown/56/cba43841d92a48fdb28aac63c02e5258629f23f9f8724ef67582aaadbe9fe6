<p><a href="https://www.kent.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/212/physics" class="btn btn-blue">APPLY</a></p>

<p><strong>We are recruiting for a fully funded PhD Studentships in Optics/Photonics/Physics</strong> for a period of 36 months with a start date in <strong>September 2023</strong> within the <a href="aogkent.uk">Applied Optics Group</a>, Division of Natural Sciences, <a href="www.kent.ac.uk">University of Kent</a>. The position is supported by the <a href="https://research.kent.ac.uk/gcdc/">Global Challenges Doctoral Centre in the University of Kent</a>.</p>

<p>The PhD project will support research and development of a low cost investigational device for noncommunicable diseases leading to blindness if not diagnosed and treated. These are preventable and lack of essential services primarily affect developing countries where clinics cannot afford current OCT instruments, expensive and bulky.</p>

<p>Research will focus on innovative solutions for portable, miniature, low cost imaging systems, that can be used by a non specialist to perform OCT imaging of the eye. The project intends to evaluate several novel avenues opened by recent research in Photonics that will be harnessed to lower significantly the cost of OCT technology. Ideally, the system should be assembled around a low cost camera or a smartphone to enable imaging patients in remote areas of developing countries, or to be used in pop-up eye clinics to screen for retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. Such a device will generate data that will enable health care providers to supply cost-effective, targeted treatment, not currently possible in low resource setting countries and environments.</p>
