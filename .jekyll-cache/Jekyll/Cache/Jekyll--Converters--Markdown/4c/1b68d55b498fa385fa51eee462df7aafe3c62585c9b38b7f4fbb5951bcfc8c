<h2 id="oct-apparatus-and-oct-method-for-axial-tracking-and-flattening">OCT apparatus and oct method for axial tracking and flattening</h2>

<h3 id="abstract">ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>The present specification relates to Master-Slave (MS) interferometry for sensing the axial position of an object subject to optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, and to MS-OCT applied to curved and axially moving objects. The methods and apparatuses allow producing OCT signals from selected depths within the object irrespective of its axial position in respect to the imaging system. Images are obtained for curved objects that are flattened along a layer of interest in the object, images that are used to provide OCT angiography images less disturbed by axial movement or lateral scanning.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-1">ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>The present invention related to an apparatus and method for master slave interferometry, referred to as Complex Master Slave (CMS). The method and apparatus can be used to provide complex-valued measurements of a signal reflected from an axial position inside an object or of signals reflected from points at several axial positions inside an object.</p>

<h3 id="abstract-2">ABSTRACT</h3>

<p>The present invention relates to spectral domain (SD) interferometry and provides apparatuses and methods, which can be used to provide measurement of a signal reflected from an axial position inside an object or of signals reflected from points at several axial positions inside an object. Embodiments are disclosed where axial reflectivity profiles are created with no need for linearization or calibration of data. The method can be used to measure distances, or for sensing applications. Axial reflectivity profiles are constructed from several measurement points acquired and processed in parallel. For imaging technology, the invention discloses apparatuses and methods to deliver in real time, in parallel, several en-face images from different depths in the volume of an object being imaged. Embodiments are
disclosed where en-face optical coherence tomography (OCT) images are created with no need for software cuts of the volume of data collected and no need of linearization or calibration of data. Embodiments are disclosed where dispersion is automatically compensated for or compounds are detected based on the spectrum measured at the output of an interferometer.</p>
