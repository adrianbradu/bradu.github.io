<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This paper demonstrates that the complex master slave interferometry (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.24.002885">CMSI</a>) method used in spectral domain interferometry (SDI) can efficiently be used for accurate refractive index and group velocity dispersion measurements of optically transparent samples. For the first time, we demonstrate the relevance of the phase information delivered by CMSI for dispersion evaluations with no need to linearize data. The technique proposed here has been used to accurately measure the group refractive index and the group velocity dispersion of a strong dispersive sample (SF6 glass), and a weak dispersive one (distilled water). The robustness of the technique is demonstrated through the manipulation of several sets of experimental data.</p>
