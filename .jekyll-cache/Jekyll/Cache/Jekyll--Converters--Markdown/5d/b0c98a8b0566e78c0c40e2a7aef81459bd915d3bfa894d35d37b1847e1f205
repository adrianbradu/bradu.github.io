<p>I am a Senior Lecturer in Physics and Astronomy at the University of Kent, and I am also a member of the Applied Optics Group. In this role, I work on developing imaging techniques that can be applied to the fields of biosciences and medicine. My research is mainly focused on imaging techniques that are based on optical coherence tomography, elastography and photoacoustic.</p>

<p>I began my career at</p>

<p><a href="https://www.uaic.ro/" class="btn btn-blue fs-5 mr-4">Alexandru Ioan Cuza University Iasi</a></p>

<p>graduating in 1997 with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BSc in Physics</code>. After graduation, I studied for my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MSc degree</code> in Optics, Optoelectronics and Microwaves at École Nationale Supérieure d’Électronique et de Radioélectricité de Grenoble (ENSERG), Grenoble, France; my MSc thesis was ‘Spectrophotometry of turbid media using optical fibre probes’. I completed my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PhD</code> in the group of Professor <strong>Jacques Derouard</strong> at Joseph Fourier University, Grenoble, France, in 2004. My PhD thesis title was <strong>Optical methods used to investigate biological tissues</strong>. <strong>Cerebral tissue spectroscopy using small optical fibre probes and optical coherence tomography imaging</strong>.</p>

<p>Several years ago, Prof. Podoleanu and I introduced a novel method to produce optical coherence tomography images, which serves as an alternative to the Fourier Transform based technique. We have developed this approach over time and submitted multiple patents on it. Additionally, we have published more than ten journal papers describing and elaborating on this technique.</p>

<p>Other research activities I am involved with:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Development of dedicated software to acquire data, display and analyse images using cutting-edge techniques and methods for camera, swept source, master-slave interferometry based Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) systems and not only.</li>
  <li>Combining spectral and time-domain interferometry principles to implement novel configurations up to proof of concept, applicable to bio-sensing and cell, tissue imaging or imaging of different organs.</li>
  <li>Imaging systems, combining a coherence gated wave-front sensors with one or more of the following imaging channels, optical coherence tomography, confocal microscopy, non-linear microscopy and then combining coherence-gated wave-front sensing with optical coherence tomography, using different or similar principles of time domain and spectral domain interferometry.</li>
  <li>Extending the axial range in swept-source optical coherence tomography using re-circulation loops is a hot topic in the OCT community. The motivation for this work is related to the fact that one of the main drawbacks of swept-source optical coherence tomography is its limited axial range. Novel interferometer configurations are tested and equipped with adjustable path length rings in each arm. By compensating for the losses in the circles using semiconductor optical amplifiers, multiple paths A-scans can be obtained, leading to a highly long overall axial range when combined axially. The effect of the re-circulation loops is equivalent to extending the coherence length of the swept source. In this way, the axial imaging range in swept-source optical coherence tomography can be extended well beyond the limit imposed by the coherence length of the laser to exceed, in principle, many centimetres.</li>
  <li>Non-invasive imaging of biological tissues: optical coherence tomography and confocal microscopy techniques for biological tissue imaging and adaptive optics techniques for retinal imaging.</li>
  <li>Spectroscopy of biological media (development, measurements, interpretation; spectroscopic techniques and numerical simulations applied to biological media, optical phantoms preparation and handling).</li>
  <li>Spectroscopy of the turbid media (development, measurements, interpretation, etc).</li>
</ul>
