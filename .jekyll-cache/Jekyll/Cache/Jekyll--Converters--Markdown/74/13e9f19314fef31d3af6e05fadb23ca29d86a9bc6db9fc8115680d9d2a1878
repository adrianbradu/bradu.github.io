<h2 id="about-the-project">About the Project</h2>
<p>In ophthalmology, functional changes, such as the oxygenation of the retinal tissue, precede structural changes, which are very often first observed using the currently available technologies, therefore having the capability to detect them earlier is of paramount importance. Nowadays, several imaging techniques including Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), which steadily is becoming the gold standard, in producing structural images are used for diagnosing eye diseases in humans. However, none of these techniques is capable to provide accurate oxygen saturation maps of the retinal tissue, critical in investigating major blinding eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. One of the imaging techniques which has the capability to provide oxygenation maps of the biological tissue is opto-acoustic tomography (OAT). Unfortunately, OAT requires contact between the instrument and the tissue, therefore it is not suitable for in-vivo imaging the eye. Recently, a novel technique based on OAT, opto-acoustic remote sensing (OARS), not requiring contact with the tissue, has been demonstrated. Through this project, the capability of OARS to deliver retinal oxygenation maps of the eyeâ€™s retina will be evaluated. To this goal, multimodality imaging instruments equipped with OARS and OCT control channels will be developed to simultaneously produce functional and structural maps. The capability of this instrument in detecting abnormal retinal oxygenation levels in the retina will be analysed with collaborators from NHS Trust.</p>
